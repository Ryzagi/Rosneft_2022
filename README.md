# Problem statement
A set of 760 discrete real-valued signals consisting of 5000 samples is given. The set of signals is divided into 9 clusters according to some characteristics and there are 4 characteristic points on each signal, which are determined by certain rules within each cluster.

For 15% of the signals, the following are set:
Belonging to 1 of 9 clusters.
4 characteristic points in each cluster have been identified.

It is necessary to make an algorithm and implement it in the form of programs, which will allow for the remaining 85% of signals:
Determine for each signal belonging to 1 of 9 clusters (task 1).
Determine for each signal all 4 characteristic points (task 2).

To evaluate the result, participants must provide:
Software solution.
A file with the results of using the software solution on the presented data.
A list of auxiliary libraries with instructions on how to install them (if required).

Note: the source data additionally includes coordinates (X, Y), which allow us to estimate the boundaries of the received clusters and exclude the absence of separate remote signals.
